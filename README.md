## Why?
Recently, a new system was launched to have more control of the taxpayers and the idea is improve de control of bills and expenses, with that a lot of changes coming for stores, business man, freelancers, etc. \
Usually people have some numer codes to describe the economic activity that they practice but with the new system that codes have changed and now the have to update the code each time that they asked for electronic invoice. \
Some of them does not know the new code, for that reason this app was created.

You can write your ID number and it will you a list of all your activities with the new code. \
So, if you are the saler you can look for the new code and ask with which one wna the onvoice or if your are the client you can give the code directly.
